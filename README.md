# Fecal contamination in agricultural water

ðŸ’§This project is dedicated to investigating the impact of various geospatial and meteorological factors on fecal contamination of watersheds.

ðŸ“– This dataset is sourced from the publication "**Green, H., Wilder, M., Wiedmann, M., Weller, D.L. Integrative survey of 68 non-overlapping upstate New York watersheds reveals stream features associated with aquatic fecal contamination. Front. Microbiol. 12 (2021). https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.684533**".

# Sample analysis

## Analysis Focus
We utilize a multidisciplinary approach to understand how different factors contribute to water quality. The project looks into:

Presence and Density: Identifying if certain factors are present upstream and calculating their density per 10 kmÂ².
Proximity: Determining the flow path distance to the nearest feature of each type.
Water Quality Indicators: Examining parameters like E. coli concentrations, microbial source tracking markers, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and more.

# Machine Learning Model Predictor

This repository contains a Python script designed to perform predictions using various machine learning models based on user-specified target labels and algorithms. The script supports several regression models and can handle both numerical and categorical data through preprocessing steps like imputation and one-hot encoding.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatic handling of numerical and categorical data including missing value imputation and one-hot encoding.
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Users can select from multiple regression models to apply on their specified target label.
- **Command Line Interface**: The script is executable from the command line, allowing users to specify the target label and choice of algorithm dynamically.
- **Binary and Continuous Predictions**: Supports both continuous and binary predictions depending on the chosen target label.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this script, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Imbalanced-Learn

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage 
- ** Command Line Execution: Run the script from the command line by specifying the target label and the algorithm you want to use.
## Required Arguments

- `--file_path` (required): The path to your CSV file.
- `--target_label` (required): The target label for the prediction model. Choose from the available target labels in the dataset.
- `--algorithm` (required): The algorithm to use. Options include `RandomForest`, `LinearRegression`, `SVM`, `GradientBoosting`.

## Optional Arguments

- `--n_estimators`: The number of trees in the forest (default: 100). Applicable for `RandomForest` and `GradientBoosting`.
  

- `--max_depth`: The maximum depth of the tree (default: None). Applicable for RandomForest and GradientBoosting.

- `--C`: The regularization parameter (default: 1.0). Applicable for the SVM algorithm.

- `--kernel`: The kernel type to be used in the algorithm (default: 'rbf'). Applicable for the SVM algorithm. Options include linear, poly, rbf, sigmoid, precomputed.

``` bash
python script.py --file_path path/to/mstdata.csv --target_label <target_label> --algorithm GradientBoosting --max_depth 5

```

## Supported Algorithms
-  RandomForest: Random Forest Regression
-  LinearRegression: Linear Regression
-  SVM: Support Vector Machines for regression
-  GradientBoosting: Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Example
``` bash
python ML_runner.py --file_path path/to/mstdata.csv --target_label remainder__ecoli --algorithm RandomForest --n_estimators 200


```
## Outputs
-  The script outputs the model's performance metrics directly to the console, including MSE and R^2 for continuous targets, or accuracy for binary targets.
-  For binary targets, predictions are automatically converted to binary outcomes based on a threshold.
## Model Evaluation Results

The following table summarizes the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the `remainder__ecoli` target label using default parameters:

| Algorithm           | MSE   | RÂ²    |
|---------------------|-------|-------|
| RandomForest        | 0.422 | 0.050 |
| LinearRegression    | 0.469 | -0.055|
| SVM                 | 0.400 | 0.101 |
| GradientBoosting    | 0.561 | -0.262|

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) scores are calculated to evaluate the models' performance.


# LazyPredict Method

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- LazyPredict
- imbalanced-learn (optional, for handling class imbalance)

Install the required packages

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn lazypredict imbalanced-learn
```

## Usage
Run the script with the datset file, file path and target column

``` bash
python ML_TEST.py --file_path /path/to/mstdata.csv --target_label remainder__ecoli
```
Available target labels:
- remainder__ecoli
- remainder__HF183_pa
- remainder__Rum2Bac_pa
- remainder__DG3_pa
- remainder__GFD_pa

## Example Output: remainder__ecoli
