# Environmental-Factors-Water-Quality-Analysis
Welcome to the Environmental Factors Water Quality Analysis repository. This project is dedicated to investigating the impact of various environmental and anthropogenic factors on water quality. Using data extracted from publicly-available databases, this repository contains analyses that explore how elements like campgrounds, culverts, dams, livestock operations, and more can influence the quality of water in different ecosystems.

##Data Overview
Our analysis is grounded in two primary resources:

##Data Dictionary: 
A comprehensive guide explaining the factors considered in our analysis, including their descriptions, data extraction dates, and citations. This dictionary covers a wide range of factors, from natural features like campgrounds and dams to human-related factors such as livestock operations and wastewater discharge sites.

mstdata.csv: A dataset containing measurements and observations relevant to the study. This data serves as the foundation for our analysis, providing quantitative insight into the presence, density, and minimum distance of various factors relative to water bodies.

##Analysis Focus
We utilize a multidisciplinary approach to understand how different factors contribute to water quality. The project looks into:

Presence and Density: Identifying if certain factors are present upstream and calculating their density per 10 kmÂ².
Proximity: Determining the flow path distance to the nearest feature of each type.
Water Quality Indicators: Examining parameters like E. coli concentrations, microbial source tracking markers, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and more.
